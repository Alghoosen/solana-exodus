  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following traits define an item `serialize`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
          candidate #1: `serde::ser::Serialize`
          candidate #2: `serde_bytes::ser::Serialize`
  = note: this error originates in an attribute macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
