## Validation-client Economics

Validator-clients are eligible to receive protocol-based (i.e. via inflation) rewards issued via stake-based annual interest rates (calculated per epoch) by providing compute (CPU+GPU) resources to validate and vote on a given PoH state. These protocol-based rewards are determined through an algorithmic disinflationary schedule as a function of total amount of circulating tokens. Additionally, these clients may earn revenue through fees via state-validation transactions and Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) transactions. The distribution of these two types of transaction fees to the participating validation set are designed independently as economic goals and attack vectors are unique between the state- generation/validation mechanism and the ledger replication/validation mechanism. For clarity, we separately describe the design and motivation of the three types of potential revenue distriubutions for validation-clients below: state-validation protocol-based rewards, state-validation transaction fees and PoRep-validation transaction fees.
