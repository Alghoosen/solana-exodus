# Running a Validator
This document describes how to participate in the Solana testnet as a
validator node.

Please note some of the information and instructions described here may change
in future releases, and documentation will be updated for mainnet participation.

## Overview
The testnet features a validator running at testnet.solana.com, which can
serve as the entrypoint to the cluster for your validator.

Additionally there is a network explorer available at
[http://explorer.solana.com/](https://explorer.solana.com/).

The testnet is configured to reset the ledger daily, or sooner,
should the hourly automated cluster sanity test fail.

There is a **#validator-support** Discord channel available to reach other
testnet participants, [https://discord.gg/pquxPsq](https://discord.gg/pquxPsq).

Also we'd love it if you choose to register your validator node with us at
[https://forms.gle/LfFscZqJELbuUP139](https://forms.gle/LfFscZqJELbuUP139).
