# Staking on Solana

## What is Staking?
Some high level info about PoS networks and staking.

## Why should I stake my SOL tokens?
 - Help secure the network
 - Grow with inflation, should it be enabled
 - Earn rewards

## How do I stake?
#### Create a Stake Account
 - Create a stake account, which is separate from a wallet address you may
 already have which is used for basic token transfers to/from other addresses.
 - Some parties may already have stake accounts created on their behalf by the
 Solana team, such as investors and service providers. If you have a stake
 account created for you, the account information will have been provided to you
 individually.

#### Delegate your Stake using a supported Wallet
Currently, staking operation are only supported by wallets that can interact
with the Solana command line tools.

We are working hard to integrate with additional wallets that will provide a
friendlier user interface for people who are not familiar with using command
line tools, please stay tuned for more information!
