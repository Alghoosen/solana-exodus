# Supported Wallets
Solana is integrated into multiple third-party wallets and also supports a native command-line wallet.  

For the majority of users, we recommend using one of the third-party solutions, which will provide a more familiar user experience rather than needing to learn command line tools.  

For advanced users or developers, the command-line based wallet may be more appropriate, as new features on the Solana blockchain will always be supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party solutions.

## Trust Wallet
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) is an app for iOS and Android.  This is currently the easiest and fastest way for most people to get set up with a new wallet on Solana.  The app is free and getting your wallet set up only takes a minute.

**NOTE: At this time, Solana is only supported on the iOS version of TrustWallet. Support for Android on Trust Wallet is coming very very soon!**

## Ledger Nano S
[Ledger Nano S](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) is a *hardware wallet* which stores the wallet's private keys on a secure device that is physically separate from the computer, and connects via USB cable.  This provides an extra level of security but requires the user to purchase and keep track of the hardware device. 

**NOTE: While Solana is fully integrated with the Ledger Nano S device, installing the Solana App on your Ledger Nano S currently requires use of our command-line tools.  Support for Solana on Ledger Live is coming very soon, which will allow users to set up and use their Solana wallet on the Ledger Live app or desktop software**

## Command Line Wallets
Solana has a full featured command line interface to support a native wallet operations using an unencrpyted keypair file or a paper wallet.  We also support CLI interface to a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.
