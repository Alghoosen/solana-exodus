## **Install docker**

If you don't have docker installed in your machine, do so by reading the reference documentation here:

[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

## **Approach A**

All components required to run bench tests are contained within `Dockerfile` and docker runs the `solana_itt_script.sh` script

You can find the step-by-step guide in folder approach-A
